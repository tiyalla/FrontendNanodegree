# About MyReads Project
A Reacts Js Project to track books users are reading. It contains a bookshelf that allows you categorize books according to what you're reading, want to read or done reading.



## Getting Started
Clone repository
To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
