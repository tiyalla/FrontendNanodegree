# Restaurant Reviews - Stage 1

## Project Overview/Task Stage 1

The goal of this project was to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Also added a service worker to begin the process of creating
a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Required functionalities
- Responsive design
- Accessibility navigation
- Offline availability with a Service Worker.

### How to Get Started. 

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.
Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people,
it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x,
spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's
 [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.


### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
